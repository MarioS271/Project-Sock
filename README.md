# Project-Sock
This is my project Sock. It is an interactive assistant. I'm not that experienced in programming yet, but I can already program a lot. This project is written in some programming languages: Batch, HTML and VBScript. It has to languages: English and German. But it only works on Windows!

### You can find all releases under the [releases](https://github.com/MarioS271/Project-Sock/releases) section.
NOTE: The Source code zip/tar.gz are not up to date, so just use the installer instead. ;)
