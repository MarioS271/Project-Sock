# Project-Sock
This is my project Sock. It is an interactive assistant. This project is written in some programming languages: Batch, HTML and VBScript. It has two languages: English and German. <b>It only works on Windows!</b>

### You can find all releases under the [releases](https://github.com/MarioS271/Project-Sock/releases) section.
### Also, check out the [english](https://sock.marios271.net/en/) or [german](https://sock.marios271.net/de/) website.

NOTE: The Source code zip/tar.gz are not actually the code (just this file and the utilities), so just use the installer instead. ;)
